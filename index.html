<!-- Hi! I'm **Your Name**, and this is my personal website. You can learn more [about me](about.md), see my [projects](projects.md), or view my [resume](resume.pdf). -->

<div class="homeps">
Thank you for visiting my website! I'm an incoming PhD student in the EECS department at UC Berkeley advised by <a href="https://sagark.org/">Professor Sagar Karandikar</a>. I love tinkering with, thinking about, and analyzing computer systems.

To me, the most urgent concern in computing is reducing carbon emissions. Between <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389921001884">2 and 4%</a> of all carbon emitted globally can be attributed to information and computing technology.

My research as an undergraduate has spanned the heart of the computing stack from microarchitecture to software systems. This includes my <a href="publications">senior thesis</a>, which focused on reducing system-on-chip emissions by sharing memory hardware between multiple hardware accelerators, and <a href="publications"><i>Omniglot</i></a>, a framework for facilitating safe interactions between programming languages with different type- and memory-safety invariants.

I spent the summer of 2023 at JPL developing embedded software for the JPL-designed Sphinx single board computer.

Less formally I've built 4 increasingly complex Pacman playing robots, a PC fan controller, a keyboard hidden in a 3-ring binder, a 544 segment display, some development boards, a benchtop power supply, a small car and smart traffic light system, added namespaces to the C programming language,

I received a bachelor's in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Princeton University this past spring, where I was lucky enough to work with Professors <a href="https://mrm.scholar.princeton.edu/">Margaret Martonosi</a>, <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~sharad/">Sharad Malik</a>, and <a href="https://www.amitlevy.com/">Amit Levy</a>. I was honored to receive Princeton ECE's top honor, the <a href="https://ece.princeton.edu/news/class-day-2025-celebrates-graduating-cohort">Charles I. Young Memorial Prize</a>.
