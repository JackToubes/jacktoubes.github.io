<!-- Hi! I'm **Your Name**, and this is my personal website. You can learn more [about me](about.md), see my [projects](projects.md), or view my [resume](resume.pdf). -->

<p>
Thank you for visiting my website! I'm an incoming PhD student in the EECS department at UC Berkeley advised by <a href="https://sagark.org/">Professor Sagar Karandikar</a>. I love tinkering with, thinking about, and analyzing computer systems.

<p>
To me, the most urgent concern in computing is reducing carbon emissions. Between <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389921001884">2 and 4%</a> of all carbon emitted globally can be attributed to information and computing technology.
</p>


<p>
My research as an undergraduate has spanned the heart of the computing stack from microarchitecture to software systems. This includes my <a href="">senior thesis</a>, which focused on reducing system-on-chip emissions by sharing memory hardware between multiple hardware accelerators, and <a href=""><i>Omniglot</i></a>, a framework for facilitating safe interactions between programming languages with differentt type- and memory-safety invariants.
</p>

<p>
I spent the summer of 2023 at JPL developing embedded software for the JPL-designed Sphinx single board computer.

Less formally I've built 4 increasingly complex Pacman playing robots, a PC fan controller, a keyboard hidden in a 3-ring binder, a 544 segment display, some development boards, a benchtop power supply, a small car and smart traffic light system, added namespaces to the C programming language,

I received a bachelor's in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Princeton University this past spring, where I was lucky enough to work with Professors <a href="https://mrm.scholar.princeton.edu/">Margaret Martonosi</a>, <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~sharad/">Sharad Malik</a>, and <a href="https://www.amitlevy.com/">Amit Levy</a>. I was honored to receive Princeton ECE's top honor, the <a href="https://ece.princeton.edu/news/class-day-2025-celebrates-graduating-cohort">Charles I. Young Memorial Prize</a>.
