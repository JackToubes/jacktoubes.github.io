<div class="homeps">
For our final project in ECE 475, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-henriques/">Ian Henriques</a> and I built a hardware accelerator for min/max heap operations, which are commonly used in priority queues and graph algorithms. Provides linear time sort and IPC=1 for sequential insert and remove operations.

Unforunately, the RTL cannot be made public as it is tightly integrated with solutions to a project for ECE 475 at Princeton.
