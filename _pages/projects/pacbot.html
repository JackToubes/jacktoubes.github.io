<div class="homeps">
Robots for playing a physically realized game of pacman for Princeton University Robotics Club <a href="https://robotics.princeton.edu/">PURC</a>. Any code and hw information we've made public is available <a href="https://github.com/princeton-robotics-club">here</a>. Our pacbots have set competition records for most points, and have done so with the lowest energy consumption and least powerful processors (we've used ATMEGAs and ESP32s vs most schools using Raspberry Pis).
